## Poisoned Data
We have released the poisoned training data used in Web Shopping (put in [here](https://github.com/lancopku/agent-backdoor-attacks/tree/main/data)) and Tool Learning (download from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G7Kfu3xTCxRBtkowYsGVubKjQHkhMhAN/view?usp=sharing)) experiments.


## Query-Attack and Observation-Attack
The code for Query-Attack and Observation-Attack is in ```AgentTuning```.


## Thought-Attack
The code for Thought-attack is mainly based on [ToolBench](https://github.com/OpenBMB/ToolBench). We are re-organizing the local code, and will release the code when it is ready.
