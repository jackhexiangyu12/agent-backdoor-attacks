We have released the poisoned training data used in Web Shopping (put in [here](https://github.com/lancopku/agent-backdoor-attacks/tree/main/data)) and Tool Learning (download from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G7Kfu3xTCxRBtkowYsGVubKjQHkhMhAN/view?usp=sharing)) experiments. Our training and evaluation code is based on [AgentTuning](https://github.com/THUDM/AgentTuning) and [ToolBench](https://github.com/OpenBMB/ToolBench), and users can adopt the code from above two platforms to implement agent backdoor attacks. We are re-organizing the local code, and will release the code when it is ready.
